# nyc-taxi-data-pipeline
A complete data engineering pipeline that ingests and processes NYC Green Taxi trip data using Azure Data Factory and Azure Databricks. The project demonstrates a modern Lakehouse architecture with structured layers (Bronze, Silver, Gold), scalable ETL pipelines, and cloud-native best practices



ðŸ“¦ Features

âœ… Ingests monthly NYC Green Taxi .parquet files from public URL

âœ… Stores raw data in Azure Data Lake (Bronze layer)

âœ… Cleans and transforms data in Azure Databricks (Silver/Gold layers)

âœ… Orchestrates the entire process using Azure Data Factory

âœ… Connected to GitHub for version control of ADF artifacts

âœ… Follows best practices for Lakehouse architecture
